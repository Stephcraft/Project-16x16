# Project 16x16 Story

## Abstract

The game will follow the main protagonist and player character in a battle to save his family from mysterious forces.

After waking up from a long slumber, the player character is surrounded by an industrial facility, and has no memory of anything prior. The player character will not be led by any guide, leaving the player to solve mysteries on his own.

The game will be mostly linear, but with an open world component. The player can explore the open world environment to practice the gameplay, and when ready, can enter the linear portions to continue the story.

The player character will remain silent for the entire game.

## Player Character Design

The player character will be designed to take one tile in width and two tiles in height. This is important to know when designing the environment. When crouching, the player character will take one tile in width and one tile in height. This allows for crouching to access tight spaces.

## Boss Design

The bosses will be designed to resemble the seasons Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. The player will obtain new skills after defeating each boss.

## Map Design

The map will be divided into five sections. These are the central area and the four surrounding elemental areas.

## Gameplay

The gameplay will be primarily combat with puzzles. The player character is equipped with a sharp blade, which is the primary weapon. The secondary weapon is an energy projectile, which can be charged and fired. All combo attacks will come from these two base attacks.

Puzzles will mainly use energy projectiles to fill orbs. When the corresponding orb is full, it will power a switch, which can be hit with the blade attack to perform functions required to progress.

There will be three meters for the life system. These are a health meter, an energy meter, and a temperature meter.

The health meter will decrease when damage is taken. If the health meter reaches zero, the player character dies, and the game restarts from the last checkpoint.

The energy meter depletes as energy is used. Energy is consumed by anything considered an energy action, such as using projectiles. The energy meter will have a minimum requirement. If the energy meter is fully depleted, it will need to refill to the minimum requirement before energy actions can be used again. The energy meter will normally refill extremely quickly, and the player will not need to manage energy much until more advanced mechanics are introduced.

The temperature meter indicates the player character's temperature. It will start at neutral, in the center. the far left indicates extreme cold, and the far right indicates extreme heat. The temperature will affect aspects of the combat, and extreme temperature will affect health. The temperature meter will remain fixed at neutral for the beginning of the game.

## Special Items

There will be special items that can be equipped to complete actions in the game. These will take the place of the blade.

## Main Story

In the distant future, the world has been heavily industrialized. Diamonds were a pursuit of mankind since immemorial times. In this pursuit, the New Industrial Revolution brought technology to create diamonds out of raw carbon. There was no longer a measurable distinction between natural diamonds and synthetic ones. This brought about a new industry, the 4C Industry. People would spend everything they had, including their life savings, and take out a loan on top of that to get their own diamond manufacturing machine, or a 4C machine, sold by a corporation named Paragon. Paragon specialized in advanced technology, and experimented with manipulation of energy. The 4C Industry, however, was the most financially stable investment for them. At first, this was a very profitable industry, but it did not last long.

Soon diamonds were flooding the streets, and people treated them as they would ordinary rocks. Over time, diamonds lost all value, with people throwing them away to make space for other minerals. Diamonds were no longer a pursuit of mankind. They became nothing more than a nuisance.

This brought about a demand for all minerals besides diamond. A new economy was created, with people trading ruby, sapphire, even lead. Yet another industry was created, with people using new technology to mine more minerals than ever before. Paragon quickly went bankrupt, and people blamed the corporation for their own bankruptcy and socioeconomic faults. Paragon did not like this, and people knew the corporation could do nothing to stop its own destruction. People were right, but they underestimated the relentlessness of this corporation. Paragon was going down, and it would not go down without taking everything it could with it.

Paragon had more than just technology to make diamonds. It had been developing its other project, a method for controlling the economy. First, Paragon offered money in exchange for everyone's diamonds. People easily gave their diamonds away for almost nothing, and the idea of diamonds was so repulsive, no one wanted them, not even for traditional purposes. Paragon sent teams to quietly and strategically cut off the world's oil supply. With no oil, people could not operate basic machinery. Paragon then used the diamonds to make diamond drilling rigs. Paragon soon owned all the oil in the world. This left no choice but to either suffer without basic technology, or to trade all minerals in for Paragon's oil.

People did not accept this, and a war soon broke out. Paragon knew this would happen, and had been prepared. It could not prosper, so it gathered all the minerals it could, and in a reckless form of self destruction, converted all minerals into carbon and then diamond, and destroyed what it couldn't convert. It used its energy manipulation to begin obtaining a level of influence previously thought impossible. With this, it could control the weather, and the seasons were thrown into chaos. Even the ground was changed, and the only remaining landmass was created by the other parts of land from other areas smashing into each other. The economy had been destroyed, the war had resulted in endangerment of all species, and the world had been completely altered. All that remained was an industrial complex, buried underground.

From the ashes of the Industry, a hero rises to reclaim what is rightfully his.

The game begins here.
