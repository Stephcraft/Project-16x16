# Project 16x16 Story

## Abstract

The game will follow the main protagonist and player character in a battle to save his family from mysterious forces.

After waking up from a long slumber, the player character is surrounded by an industrial facility, and has no memory of anything prior. The player character will not be led by any guide, leaving the player to solve mysteries on his own.

The game will be mostly linear, but with an open world component. The player can explore the open world environment to practice the gameplay, and when ready, can enter the linear portions to continue the story.

The player character will remain silent for the entire game.

## Player Character Design

The player character will be designed to take one tile in width and two tiles in height. This is important to know when designing the environment. When crouching, the player character will take one tile in width and one tile in height. This allows for crouching to access tight spaces.

## Boss Design

The bosses will be designed to resemble the seasons Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. The player will obtain new skills after defeating each boss.

## Map Design

The map will be divided into five sections. These are the central area and the four surrounding elemental areas.

## Gameplay

The gameplay will be primarily combat with puzzles. The player character is equipped with a sharp blade, which is the primary weapon. The secondary weapon is an energy projectile, which can be charged and fired. All combo attacks will come from these two base attacks.

Puzzles will mainly use energy projectiles to fill orbs. When the corresponding orb is full, it will power a switch, which can be hit with the blade attack to perform functions required to progress.

There will be three meters for the life system. These are a health meter, an energy meter, and a temperature meter.

The health meter will decrease when damage is taken. If the health meter reaches zero, the player character dies, and the game restarts from the last checkpoint.

The energy meter depletes as energy is used. Energy is consumed by anything considered an energy action, such as using projectiles. The energy meter will have a minimum requirement. If the energy meter is fully depleted, it will need to refill to the minimum requirement before energy actions can be used again. The energy meter will normally refill extremely quickly, and the player will not need to manage energy much until more advanced mechanics are introduced.

The temperature meter indicates the player character's temperature. It will start at neutral, in the center. the far left indicates extreme cold, and the far right indicates extreme heat. The temperature will affect aspects of the combat, and extreme temperature will affect health. The temperature meter will remain fixed at neutral for the beginning of the game.

## Special Items

There will be special items that can be equipped to complete actions in the game. These will take the place of the blade.
