# Project 16x16 (Sardonyx) Story

## Abstract

The game will follow the main protagonist and player character in a battle to save his family from mysterious forces.

After waking up from a long slumber, the player character is surrounded by an industrial facility, and has no memory of anything prior. The player character will not be led by any guide, leaving the player to solve mysteries on his own.

The game will be mostly linear, but with an open world component. The player can explore the open world environment to practice the gameplay, and when ready, can enter the linear portions to continue the story.

The player character will remain silent for the entire game.

## Player Character Design

The player character will be designed to take one tile in width and one tile in height. This is important to know when designing the environment. When crouching, the player character will take one tile in width and half a tile in height. This allows for crouching to access tight spaces.

## Boss Design

The bosses will be designed to resemble the seasons Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. The player will obtain new skills after defeating each boss.

## Map Design

The map will be divided into five sections. These are the central area and the four surrounding elemental areas.

## Gameplay

The gameplay will be primarily combat with puzzles. The player character is equipped with a sharp blade, which is the primary weapon. The secondary weapon is an energy projectile, which can be charged and fired. All combo attacks will come from these two base attacks.

Puzzles will mainly use energy projectiles to fill orbs. When the corresponding orb is full, it will power a switch, which can be hit with the blade attack to perform functions required to progress.

There will be three meters for the life system. These are a health meter, an energy meter, and a temperature meter.

The health meter will decrease when damage is taken. If the health meter reaches zero, the player character dies, and the game restarts from the last checkpoint.

The energy meter depletes as energy is used. Energy is consumed by anything considered an energy action, such as using projectiles. The energy meter will have a minimum requirement. If the energy meter is fully depleted, it will need to refill to the minimum requirement before energy actions can be used again. The energy meter will normally refill extremely quickly, and the player will not need to manage energy much until more advanced mechanics are introduced.

The temperature meter indicates the player character's temperature. It will start at neutral, in the center. the far left indicates extreme cold, and the far right indicates extreme heat. The temperature will affect aspects of the combat, and extreme temperature will affect health. The temperature meter will remain fixed at neutral for the beginning of the game.

## Main Story

In the distant future, the world has been heavily industrialized. Diamonds were a pursuit of mankind since immemorial times. In this pursuit, the New Industrial Revolution brought technology to create diamonds out of raw carbon. There was no longer a measurable distinction between natural diamonds and synthetic ones. This brought about a new industry, the 4C Industry. People would spend everything they had, including their life savings, and take out a loan on top of that to get their own diamond manufacturing machine, or a 4C machine, sold by a corporation named Paragon. Paragon specialized in advanced technology, and experimented with manipulation of energy. The 4C Industry, however, was the most financially stable investment for them. At first, this was a very profitable industry, but it did not last long.

Soon diamonds were flooding the streets, and people treated them as they would ordinary rocks. Over time, diamonds lost all value, with people throwing them away to make space for other minerals. Diamonds were no longer a pursuit of mankind. They became nothing more than a nuisance.

This brought about a demand for all minerals besides diamond. A new economy was created, with people trading ruby, sapphire, even lead. Yet another industry was created, with people using new technology to mine more minerals than ever before. Paragon quickly went bankrupt, and people blamed the corporation for their own bankruptcy and socioeconomic faults. Paragon did not like this, and people knew the corporation could do nothing to stop its own destruction. People were right, but they underestimated the relentlessness of this corporation. Paragon was going down, and it would not go down without taking everything it could with it.

Paragon had more than just technology to make diamonds. It had been developing its other project, a method for controlling the economy. First, Paragon offered money in exchange for everyone's diamonds. People easily gave their diamonds away for almost nothing, and the idea of diamonds was so repulsive, no one wanted them, not even for traditional purposes. Paragon sent teams to quietly and strategically cut off the world's oil supply. With no oil, people could not operate basic machinery. Paragon then used the diamonds to make diamond drilling rigs. Paragon soon owned all the oil in the world. This left no choice but to either suffer without basic technology, or to trade all minerals in for Paragon's oil.

People did not accept this, and a war soon broke out. Paragon knew this would happen, and had been prepared. It could not prosper, so it gathered all the minerals it could, and in a reckless form of self destruction, converted all minerals into carbon and then diamond, and destroyed what it couldn't convert. It used its energy manipulation to begin obtaining a level of influence previously thought impossible. With this, it could control the weather, and the seasons were thrown into chaos. Even the ground was changed, and the only remaining landmass was created by the other parts of land from other areas smashing into each other. The economy had been destroyed, the war had resulted in endangerment of all species, and the world had been completely altered. All that remained was an industrial complex, buried underground.

From the ashes of the Industry, a hero rises to reclaim what is rightfully his.

The game begins here.

### Introduction

All tutorial icons in this section are displayed after a delay if the player does not perform the action. This is used only as a hint.

The player character wakes up in an industrial facility as a result of the entire facility shaking. He is in an empty metal room. He pulls a syringe made of diamond out of his neck. This is added to the inventory. (Add Diamond Syringe to Inventory)

(Display Added to Inventory icon)

(Display tutorial Tab icon)

(Display tutorial A and D icons)

The entrance to the room is sealed. Approaching the entrance gives a message.

(Display tutorial E icon)

Interacting with the entrance gives a message.

(Display main message 'The entrance is sealed tightly.')

After interacting with the entrance, the facility shakes, with the sound of metal grinding. A large hole opens in the wall opposite the entrance. This is large enough for the player character to walk through normally.

Walking through the opening leads to a room with a raised platform, connected to the opposite wall.

(Display tutorial Space icon)

After jumping onto the platform, there is a door on the far wall. Interacting with the door opens it. Walking through leads to a room with a diamond sword. Interacting with the sword picks it up and adds it to the inventory.

(Add Diamond Sword to Inventory)

After obtaining the diamond sword, the facility shakes again, this time with more intensity. Another hole opens in the opposite wall. Walking through the opening leads to a room with a single enemy oil bot. This is the first enemy encounter, and lets the player get used to basic combat.

(Display tutorial LMB icon)

The oil bot will die after a few hits. After defeating the oil bot, the facility shakes again, breaking a piece of the ceiling to use as a ramp to climb. Climbing leads to a room with the first puzzle, a simple orb on the other side of the room.

(Display tutorial RMB icon)

Firing a projectile will fill the orb halfway, requiring two projectiles to activate. Activating the orb will unlock a door on the opposite wall, indicated with a red light for locked, and a green light for unlocked. Interacting with locked doors gives a sound.

(Play Door Locked sound)

Interacting with the door after it is unlocked will open it.

The next room has a wall separating it in the middle. There is a window in the wall. The window is too small to jump through. On the other side, a badly damaged oil bot is holding a switch, keeping the wall in place. The oil bot is making a robotic laughing sound. Firing a single energy projectile through the window is enough to kill the oil bot. This releases the switch, raising the wall. There is a door on the other side.

The door leads to a room with another oil bot, protected by a shield. Firing an energy projectile is not enough to break the shield, and when approaching the oil bot, it fires a pulse that pushes the player character back.

(Display tutorial Hold RMB icon)

The first charge level is enough to break the shield. The oil bot will attack. After defeating it, the facility will shake again, opening a hole in the opposite wall. This time, The hole does not lead to a room, but reveals a locked door. There is an orb on the ceiling, which is revealed by the ceiling crumbling slightly after the player interacts with the door. This orb requires three energy projectiles to activate.

(Display tutorial W icon)

Activating the orb unlocks the door. Going through the door leads to a narrow passage. On the ceiling, there is a square panel switch. This is close enough to hit with the blade.

Hitting the switch opens a door on the opposite side of the passage. Going through the door leads to a room with a collapsed passage on the opposite side. This is too small to fit through normally.

(Display tutorial S icon)

While walking through the passage, the facility starts to shake violently, and crawlers start attacking from the holes in the floor.

Attacking while crouched attacks downwards.

Emerging from the passage leads to a room with sunlight shining through a hatch at the top of a large staircase. The facility is shaking violently, and the sound of metal crushing is intense. While climbing the stairs, the facility begins collapsing rapidly behind the player character.

Interacting with the hatch activates a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The lighting changes. Emerging from the hatch causes the screen to go white, and the colors of the outdoor environment shine. This should be a breathtaking moment for the player, with the true visuals standing out. This lasts a few moments, then the industrial tone of the visuals returns slightly.

(Cutscene end)

### Section 1

Ignis

(Display Text 'Section 1')

(Display Large Text 'Ignis')

After exiting the underground facility, the player character notices a man standing to the left. Interacting with the man gives dialogue.

(Old Man First Encounter Dialogue)

"Oh, my! Did you hear that noise? I could have sworn the ground would split again."

"..."

(Brief pause)

"Not much of a talker, eh? Don't worry. I was like you at your age, you know."

"I'm one of the oldest here. The oldest left alive, anyway. I saw you come out of that hole in the ground."

"You seem confused. Ah, yes, I would know that look anywhere. My grandson had the same look when I tried explaining the 4C Industry to him. You youths just don't understand what it was like in my day. Everything was about diamonds, but there were hardly any. Now they're everywhere, and they mean nothing. You see, I... Oh, right, you were confused. I remember now! Well, if you're lost, I know this place like the back of my sapphire. Tell you what, I'll give you a map, seeing as I don't need it myself. Just head towards Bingera, to the left. That's right, left. You know where that is, right? Left."

"..."

"You still look confused. Well, find the Chief there, and he'll get you up to date. You hear? The Chief. I'll see you around, kid."

(End dialogue)

The man falls asleep while standing.

(Add Map to Inventory)

(Display Added to Inventory icon)

Walking past the man without interacting with him gives optional dialogue.

(Old Man Missed Dialogue, coming from the side of the screen)

"That's right, just walk by me. I'm definitely not here."

(End dialogue)

The environment is now bright and sunny, with industrial metal flooring everywhere. Proceeding left leads to a fiery passage on the back wall, leading to a large mountainous background. This is the entrance to the Summer area. This is locked for now, and interacting with it is not possible. The player character will need to continue left.

Continuing left leads to a wooden sign pointing left, with the word Bingera carved into it.

Continuing further leads to a section of enemies and puzzles.

The first section of enemies is a basic formation of one large oil bot and two normal oil bots, with the large oil bot in the center. After defeating these enemies, the next section is a basic puzzle introducing wedges to change projectile direction. Solving this drops a metal wall blocking the way, letting the player character continue. A diamond also falls from the opening in the wall, which can be picked up.

After passing the enemies and puzzles, The player character reaches Bingera. This is a town with old, scratched up metal lining the ground, and the town is surrounded by partly destroyed metal walls.

This is Bingera. This will serve as the central area of the game. Upon entering Bingera, the town is silent, except for a single weapons crafter banging on a sword. The other side is blocked by a large vehicle. The player character currently has nowhere else to go. Approaching the town gives dialogue.

(Outside Bingera Dialogue, from the edge of the left of the screen, small text to represent mumbling)

"Why you... What... Ugh..."

(End dialogue)

Interacting with the weapons crafter gives dialogue.

(Weapons Crafter First Encounter Dialogue)

"What do you want?"

"..."

"Silent type, huh? Hmm. You must be looking for Chief. Unfortunately, I think he's wandered off to the temple. He sure does take that praying stuff seriously. He thinks it'll fix that truck blocking the way. You know what fixes things? Weapons! I love making them, so that's what I do. Chief doesn't hurry back when he goes there, so you'll need to go after him. The temple's that way, behind me. Just give me one second to move."

"..."

"Wait, you're not going to the temple with that diamond sword, are you?"

"..."

"Are you trying to get killed? Diamond's strong, sure, but it's brittle, and it'll break quickly if you just go swinging it around. You need to bring a real weapon if you're going that way. You need to bring a good, strong steel blade with you, like this one here. It's got a nice firm hilt, and even has a slot in the pommel to put different minerals."

"..."

"Oh, no, don't look at me like that."

"..."

"You know what, I don't like you looking at me like that, and I'm in a good mood, so I'm going to give you this sword to make you go away. Just let me finish making it."

He continues talking while finishing the blade.

"Normally you could just keep going through town, and you wouldn't have to look at me like that."

"..."

"The problem is there's a truck in the way. It just showed up, driving on its own. Now it won't move, and Chief thinks praying will fix it."

"If you're going to use this sword, make sure you understand how it works. What's your mineral?"

"..."

"You look like you have no idea what I'm talking about. You do know about minerals, don't you?"

"..."

"You really don't know? Okay, listen, this is important. Minerals power things. More importantly, they power people. Everyone has a different mineral, amplifying his power. It's not just for fun, either. We need them. If you go for too long without yours, you'll die. I'm surprised you made it this far without one. You'd better find your mineral soon."

"This sword has a slot in the pommel, which means it has the added benefit of mineral powerups. Put a mineral in, and it'll change the effects of the sword."

He finishes the blade.

"There you go, now get out of here before you start looking at me like that again."

(End dialogue)

(Update Diamond Sword in Inventory to Steel Blade)

The weapons crafter moves, opening a path to the temple. On the way to the temple, the player character encounters a mysterious man wearing a cloak. The man is floating, and has a large blue energy shield around him. This encounter gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man First Encounter Dialogue)

"You're awake. Good."

"..."

"It's better if you don't speak. You don't remember, but I do. I know your past. I know what you want. I know what you're looking for. I know what you need. I'll see you soon."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man floats away.

Proceeding to the right leads to enemies and puzzles. (Incomplete)

After reaching the temple, there are oil bots surrounding several people calling for help. Defeating the enemies is required for progression. After saving the people, they quickly run away. Proceeding to the right leads to the entrance of the temple, a large metal structure. The entrance is blocked by a locked door. The Chief is standing next to the entrance. Next to him is a young girl performing a ceremony with a piece of copper, with her mother standing beside her. Interacting with the Chief gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

(Chief Outside Temple Dialogue)

"Ah, hello! You must be the one who saved my fellow citizens. My name is Chief, and I'm also the chief of Bingera. I saw you from afar, and your ability with that blade is amazing. I would've helped, but I'm in no condition to on account of my leg being sliced by one of those bots."

"You must be the one from underground."

"..."

"Don't look so surprised. I've heard of the one sealed in the old facility, and your ability with that blade isn't something people learn these days. I heard the place shake from over here, and the only time it's done that before is when the world was merged into one piece of land. I've heard of you from the ancient texts, and now you're here, just on time."

"The texts not only foretold your emergence, but also your memory loss. You are the Hero of the Industry, there's no mistaking it. Yes, you are destined to find something."

"..."

"I can see that look of curiosity. The texts told me much, but not what that thing is, unfortunately. I know you must be confused, so let me explain what happened."

"Many generations ago, the world was thrown into conflict. The corporation Paragon started making machines, called 4C Machines, that were capable of making diamonds that could not be distinguished from natural ones. Not only could people put carbon in and transform it into diamond, but also separate other materials and extract the carbon to make even more diamond. This brought about the 4C Industry, with everyone investing his money into these machines. Paragon and the people profited enormously from this mutual venture, and people lived well. However, this could not last long, because each time a diamond was made, the value of all the others decreased slightly. Eventually, people didn't want diamonds anymore, and they became worth less than nothing. People blamed Paragon for this, and people began trading other minerals. Ruby, sapphire, lead, and many others became parts of this new Industry. Paragon soon became bankrupt, and for good reason. Finally, Paragon, frustrated with the people and its own failures, found a way to manipulate energy, and began a war with the people. This led to the complete destruction of the environment, and Paragon installed their strange new metal alloy into the ground, making the world an outdoor industrial facility. The seasons were thrown into chaos, and nothing could survive without Paragon's support. Paragon also destroyed the other minerals, leaving almost nothing but diamond. Paragon ultimately won, but it could not survive without the people to give it money, and it soon perished. Without Paragon's energy to support life, everyone started to die. People started to find power in minerals, with each person able to harness the energy of a different mineral. This gave temporary assistance, but people still couldn't survive the extreme weather, and they needed the shelter of the alloy created by Paragon to guard them. This left the people in the center of the land, with the outer regions too extreme. Many have traveled to the outer areas to try to claim what minerals were left, and few have returned."

"This leaves you, the Hero of the Industry, freshly awakened from his slumber in the old facility, to restore order to the world."

"Or so the texts go, anyway. I'm not certain if this is how history really went, but here we are, and it certainly makes sense to me."

The girl next to the Chief is moving the copper around, and it starts to glow.

"Chief! Look! I found my mineral!"

"Very good, Alice, now use it well."

"I will!"

The girl runs off.

"It seems she has found her gem. Now go find yours, before it's too late."

The mother is visibly upset.

"Copper? A gem? That's a piece of scrap. Why couldn't it be ruby, or emerald, or anything else?"

"Thank you too, Nancy."

The mother follows her daughter.

"This ceremony normally takes place in the temple, but it's been overrun by bots. I had to lock the door for the people's safety, but the bots are no match for you."

The door to the temple unlocks.

"Go ahead, and save the people from the chaos."

(End dialogue)

Interacting with the Chief again gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Temple Again Dialogue)

"What are you waiting for? Go, save the people."

(End dialogue)

The only path for the player now is into the temple. Entering reveals a massive puzzle, with the first of the more complex puzzle mechanics. (Incomplete)

The temple has oil everywhere. The oil is not hazardous to the player character, but is too thick to move through, making the normal path to the back of the temple impassable. The player character needs to solve puzzles to lower platforms to reach the back. Enemies are numerous.

After completing the puzzles and defeating enemies, the player character reaches the back of the temple. There is a piece of aquamarine in a separate room. Upon approaching the aquamarine, it is pulled under the oil. This gives dialogue.

(Aquamarine Temple Mini Boss Dialogue)

"You... Give me... Flesh..."

(End dialogue)

(Display Text 'Dieselbot, Machine of Oil')

This is the first mini boss.

Dieselbot attacks with normal oil bot attacks, but has larger projectiles, and has much more health and mobility. Dieselbot does more damage and is more aggressive than normal oil bots.

After defeating Dieselbot, the oil returns to water, opening the path through the temple. The aquamarine emerges from the water, shining bright blue. The shine fades, and interacting with it adds it to the inventory.

(Add Aquamarine to Inventory)

The path to the door of the temple is now filled with water, making it passable. Exiting leads to the outside, with the Chief healed from his leg injury. Walking outside without the aquamarine gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Temple Without Aquamarine Dialogue)

"You won't get far without the aquamarine. Why did you leave it?"

(End dialogue)

Leaving the temple with the aquamarine gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Temple With Aquamarine Dialogue)

"Oh, yes, go ahead and just take that. It's not like I didn't give you permission. Just use it for what you like. I won't be upset."

(End dialogue)

Continuing back to Bingera is the only path available. After reaching Bingera, the weapons crafter is waiting. This gives dialogue.

(Weapons Crafter After Temple Dialogue)

"Well, look at that. You really got rid of the oil bots, huh? Good work. This truck is still in the way, but it should be moving soon now that those bots are gone. I don't know how that works, so don't ask me."

(End dialogue)

The only path available is towards the Summer area. After reaching it, the entrance can be interacted with. This causes the aquamarine to start glowing, and the fiery path clears. The aquamarine is powered down. The old man approaches from the right. This gives dialogue.

(Change Aquamarine Description in Inventory 'The aquamarine has lost its glow. It cannot be used like this.')

(Old Man After Opening Summer Area Dialogue)

"Well, you did it! I knew you would. You should be careful in there though, it's dangerous. The flames of the hot summer can burn you quickly. Make sure you don't get too close to the oil in there, it's hot. You know, I once got near a flame and had a large blister for months on my... Oh, that's right, you need to save mankind! I'll let you get to it."

(End dialogue)

The only path for the player is towards the Summer area.

Summer Area

The Summer area is filled with dry, cracked ground and dried withered leaves. The oil in this area is extremely hot, and will burn the player character quickly. This will introduce the temperature meter. The first hot oil is immediately in front of the player character, and increases the temperature meter to full instantly. This causes the player character to take damage and jump backwards. The temperature meter decreases back to normal, and health decrease stops.

The hot oil provides many options for puzzles and challenges. (Incomplete)

With the hot oil in the way, the player character needs to go over the normal path, and this requires jumping, puzzle solving, and combat. (Incomplete)

As the player character progresses through the Summer area, the environment becomes gradually more natural, and the temperature becomes more intense. Enemies are affected by this heat, and begin moving faster. Oil on its own will not harm the player character, but it will slow him down, and walking in hot oil always increases the temperature meter to the maximum level.

After reaching the end of the Summer area, the player character enters a large battle area. The entrance becomes engulfed in flame, blocking the exit. The temperature becomes very hot, and is just under the point where the player character will start taking damage.

The mysterious man appears. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man Summer Area Dialogue)

"So you've finally decided to face the heat created by Paragon. Good. I have something for you."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man summons a giant robotic beast surrounded by fire. The mysterious man floats away.

(Begin Summer Boss Battle)

(Display Text 'Commander of Flame')

(Display Large Text 'Flagrare')

This is Flagrare, the Summer boss.

Because this is the first boss, it will be the simplest. Flagrare starts by shooting fire projectiles quickly. He also causes hot oil to rise from the ground. Platforming and dodging is essential at this point. Flagrare's feet are vulnerable, but are only exposed when he lifts his feet out of the hot oil and places them on one of the platforms. After attacking his feet, his head drops and becomes exposed to attack. The player character will need to do significant damage to the head to defeat Flagrare.

Upon defeating Flagrare, he bursts into flames and burns to a pile of ash. The ash blows away, revealing a bright red glowing mineral. Interacting with the mineral adds amber to the inventory.

(Add Amber to Inventory)

After obtaining the amber, Flagrare's ashes return and form a glowing red ball in the center of the battle area. Interacting with it gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The glowing red ball surrounds the player character and infuses him with the power of fire.

(Display Message 'The blazing heat of Summer is now at your command.')

This unlocks fire projectiles. Fire projectiles replace the default energy projectiles.

The aquamarine is recharged.

(Display Message 'The aquamarine has been replenished.')

(Cutscene end)

(End Summer Boss Battle)

At this point, the aquamarine can be used to open the exit from the battle area, and can convert all the hot oil in the Summer area to water. This makes it possible to walk through the water and return to the entrance of the Summer area easily.

Upon returning to the entrance of the Summer area, the Chief is waiting outside. This gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Summer Area Dialogue)

"It seems you've conquered the heat of Summer. I have something to tell you. Meet me at the temple."

(End dialogue)

### Section 2

Ventus

(Display Text 'Section 2')

(Display Large Text 'Ventus')

Continuing to Bingera, the player character encounters the weapons crafter. This gives dialogue.

(Weapons Crafter After Summer Area Dialogue)

"Look at that! The truck's gone! I still don't know how it works, but I'm not complaining. Here, take this."

He gives the player character lepidolite.

(Add Lepidolite to Inventory)

"This'll let you get to areas that are too hot otherwise."

(End dialogue)

The player character can now reach the entire central area by going left, but everything is currently locked. The player character needs to continue to the temple.

Some sections of the path to the temple are accessible with the lepidolite. (Incomplete)

After reaching the temple, the Chief is waiting. This gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Temple After Summer Area Dialogue)

"You have defeated the beast that plagued the land of heat. Very good. This tells me you must be the Hero of the Industry. However, you seem to not know some of the more advanced combat techniques. Follow me."

(End dialogue)

The player character follows the Chief into the temple. They enter an empty room in the back.

(Advanced Combat Tutorial)

The Chief stops in the room and waits for the player character. This gives dialogue.

(Chief Advanced Combat Tutorial Dialogue)

"The temple is much nicer without those bots. Now, I'm going to bring in a bot."

"..."

"Oh, not a real bot. This is a dummy bot. It will only do what it's programmed to do, hopefully."

"..."

"Let's get started. Stand there, and I'll bring out the bot."

The Chief leaves, and an oil bot enters.

"You already know how to use your blade, but maybe you don't know everything you can do with it. First, you need to learn how to move properly. Sometimes enemies will be too quick for you to dodge normally. Try dashing. Press Shift while moving left or right."

The dialogue stops until the player character performs a dash.

"Good. That's called a dash. While dashing, attack with the blade to do a lunging attack. Try hitting the bot with it."

The dialogue stops until the player character hits the bot with a lunging attack.

"Very good. Next, you should learn the charged dash. Do what you normally do to use energy projectiles, but do it during a dash. Go ahead and try it on the bot."

The dialogue stops until the player character hits the bot with a charged dash.

"Yes. Now try charging your energy, and while holding it, attack with the blade."

The dialogue stops until the player character hits the bot with a charged blade attack.

"Good. Now this one is a bit boring, but it's important. Try charging your energy, and while holding it, attack upwards with the blade."

The bot pulls out an energy shield, and the dialogue stops until the player character hits the bot with energy spikes. This disarms the bot of its shield.

"See? A bit boring, but I thought you should know it. Anyway, let's move to the next attack."

A second oil bot enters from the other side of the room, surrounding the player character.

"What are you doing here? This is a private session. Well, I suppose this presents an opportunity to learn the next attack. Try charging your energy and slamming the blade into the ground."

The bots get close to the player character, and the dialogue stops until the player character hits both the bots with an AOE energy attack.

"Good. Have you had enough?"

The second oil bot leaves.

"I thought so. Now, do a charged dash attack, and at the end of the dash, attack with the blade. Try it on the bot."

The dialogue stops until the player character hits the bot with a massive energy blade attack.

"Okay, that's all. You can leave, Henry."

The oil bot leaves, and the Chief returns to the room.

"And that's all. I'm not really sure what that all means, I just read from the texts. It looks like you did a good job, though. Now go, and save the people."

(End dialogue)

(End Advanced Combat Tutorial)

The Chief leaves the temple. Exiting the temple, the Chief is waiting outside. Interacting with him gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Temple After Advanced Combat Tutorial Dialogue)

"What are you waiting for? Go save the people."

(End dialogue)

The only path for the player character is towards Bingera. Entering Bingera leads to the weapons crafter. This gives dialogue.

"You look like you just learned some new moves. I know that look, I saw it in myself when I learned some combat. It won't get you far unless you use it properly though, so be careful."

(End dialogue)

At this point, interacting with the weapons crafter gives optional dialogue.

(Weapons Crafter Gem Optional Dialogue)

"Ever notice people in this town seem to confuse gems with minerals?"

(End dialogue)

The path is now open to continue past Bingera. The Chief appears before the player character leaves Bingera. This gives dialogue.

(Chief In Bingera Dialogue)

"I almost forgot to give you this. The texts told me you would need it."

(End dialogue)

The Chief gives the player character jasper.

(Add Jasper to Inventory)

The jasper allows the player character to open the path to the Fall area. Continuing left leads to the rest of the central area. This area is now fully unlocked except for sealed doors. (Incomplete)

Interacting with a sealed door gives a message.

(Sealed Door Message 'The door is sealed, and there is no apparent locking mechanism.')

The Fall area is closed with gusts of wind that push back the player character. Using the jasper calms the winds, allowing the player character to enter.

Interacting with the entrance to the Fall area without the jasper gives a message.

(Display Message 'The wind is too strong to enter.')

Interacting with the entrance with the jasper gives a message.

(Display Message 'The jasper has calmed the intense winds.')

The jasper is powered down.

(Change Jasper Description in Inventory 'The jasper has stopped glowing. It cannot be used like this.')

Fall Area

The Fall area is a place of strong gusts. The wind is intense, and can push the player character in different directions. This gives options for puzzles. (Incomplete)

During one of the puzzles, the wind is too strong to pass. The player character falls into a large crevice, landing next to the corpse of a fallen adventurer. He has a rope next to him. Interacting with this adds it to the inventory.

(Add Rope to Inventory)

This introduces the special weapon mechanic. Special weapons can be equipped from the inventory. Pressing Q switches quickly between the blade and the most recent special weapon.

Using the rope tosses a line of rope in front of the player character. This attaches to the first object it hits, and acts as a grappling hook. It pulls smaller enemies like crawlers towards the player character, and pulls the player character towards anything larger than him. This makes the puzzle completable by grappling through the wind.

After reaching the end of the Fall area, the player character enters a large battle area. The entrance seals with gusts of wind, blocking the exit.

The mysterious man appears. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man Fall Area Dialogue)

"Really? You're going to keep this up? If you are, then so am I. Okay then, here you go."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man summons a large robotic creature surrounded in gusts of wind.

(Begin Fall Area Boss Battle)

(Display Text 'Commander of Gusts')

(Display Large Text 'Notus')

Notus is the boss of the Fall area. He manipulates the wind to push the player character, making maneuvering very difficult. The rope is necessary for this battle. Notus uses wind to throw rocks at the player character, and lifts him using gusts to throw him into spikes. If the player character is thrown, he can recover using the rope to reach safety. Notus's movement is quick and agile, flying around the battle area. Notus needs to be knocked down by throwing fire projectiles into the wind lifting him. His wings protect him while on the ground, but he can be easily angered and made vulnerable by the energy spike attack. Equipping the lepidolite makes the heat from the fire projectiles in the wind more bearable.

After defeating Notus, he dissolves into wind and blows away, leaving onyx on the ground beneath him. Interacting with the onyx adds it to the inventory.

(Add Onyx to Inventory)

The winds of Notus surround the center of the battle area, making a ball of gusts. Interacting with the ball gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The gusts surround the player character and infuse him with the power of wind.

(Display Message 'The raging winds of Fall are now at your command.')

This unlocks wind projectiles.

The jasper is recharged.

(Display Message 'The jasper has been replenished.')

(Cutscene end)

The jasper can be used to calm the winds blocking the exit, and can open a path to reach the beginning of the Fall area easily.

After leaving the Fall area, the old man appears. This gives dialogue.

(Old Man After Fall Area Dialogue)

"Look at you, conquering those beasts! When I was your age I had a nice blade just like that one, but I didn't learn how to use it like you do. See, when I was... Oh, you should get going! Time to save humanity, right?"

"..."

"You sure are quiet. I'll see you later, kid."

(End dialogue)

### Section 3

Glacies

(Display Text 'Section 3')

(Display Large Text 'Glacies')

The old man leaves. At this point the player character can use the fire and wind projectiles together to melt the ice on the entrance to the Winter area. (Incomplete)

The player character can proceed directly to the Winter area, or can explore the open world environment. There are many sealed doors scattered across the open world. (Incomplete)

The Winter area is blocked by a large wall of ice. Trying to melt this with fire projectiles alone does not work. First, the player character needs to use fire projectiles, then use wind projectiles to spread the flames. This melts the ice, opening the entrance.

Winter Area

The Winter area is a cold land filled with blizzards. This obstructs view on the ground, and the player character needs to traverse platforms to progress.

In the Winter area, the temperature meter is at the coldest position, and the amber needs to be equipped at all times to prevent health decrease.

(Incomplete)

Upon reaching the end of the Winter area, the player character enters a large battle area. A wall of ice forms, blocking the exit. The mysterious man appears. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man Winter Area Dialogue)

"Would you look at this? At first I thought you were just playing, but now I can tell you're serious about this. Let's go again."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man summons a large robotic creature made of ice.

(Display Text 'Commander of Ice')

(Display Large Text 'Cailleach')

This is the Winter area boss battle. Cailleach has one eye and is withered. She attacks by throwing spikes of ice and blowing snow to obstruct vision. The difficulty for this boss is not in damage, but in being able to see the enemy through the snow. Cailleach freezes the player character often, and moving back and forth speeds up the defrost process. She does not do much damage directly, but causes the temperature meter to decrease quickly when caught in her flurries. This depletes health rapidly. Fire projectiles do not work against her, and the only way to move the snow to reach her eye is with wind projectiles or by using the rope. Her eye is her only vulnerable spot.

After defeating Cailleach, she turns to snow and blows away in the wind. The mysterious man returns. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man After Defeating Cailleach Dialogue)

"Ha. You really are serious, aren't you? Good. Maybe you'll soon be ready to see what really happened before. Take this. Call it an incentive to keep fighting."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man drops sapphire on the ground and floats away. Interacting with it adds it to the inventory.

(Add Sapphire to Inventory)

The snow of Cailleach returns to the battle area and makes a white glowing ball in the center. Interacting with the ball gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The ball of snow surrounds the player character and infuses him with the power of ice.

(Display Message 'The chilling ice of Winter is now at your command.')

This unlocks ice projectiles.

The ice on the exit melts.

(Cutscene end)

The sapphire allows the player character to see through the blizzards, making the path on the ground to the entrance of the Winter area passable. The lower altitude also increases the temperature, allowing the player character to survive without the amber. The player character leaves the Winter area.

### Section 4

Natura

(Display Text 'Section 4')

(Display Large Text 'Natura')

The final area is the Spring area, but it is inaccessible. The thick vines at the entrance grow back too quickly when cut or burned. The player character needs to use ice projectiles to freeze the vines, then fire projectiles, then wind projectiles to spread the flames. This removes the vines, but a large wall of diamond remains. The player character needs to return later.

The weapons crafter is waiting in Bingera. Approaching him gives dialogue.

(Weapons Crafter After Winter Area Dialogue)

"Hey! You look stronger. I have something for you, since Chief wanted you to have it. Something about the radio waves or something, I don't know. Just take it, and stop looking at me like that."

(End dialogue)

The weapons crafter gives the player character onyx.

(Add Onyx to Inventory)

The exit from the underground facility only leads left, with the path to the right blocked by rubble. Upon approaching this area with the onyx, the onyx and facility both begin glowing. This gives a message.

(Display Message 'The facility is responding to the onyx.')

The rubble from the facility shifts, revealing a large open elevator. Interacting with the elevator makes it begin declining slowly. This leads to an area full of diamond and metal.

Underground Facility Area

The elevator stops part of the way down, with a path to the right. Going right leads to a large room with metal walls. There is a piece of sardonyx in the center of the floor. As the player character approaches the sardonyx, it begins glowing red. Interacting with it gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The sardonyx is glowing brightly, and the player character is about to take it. The mysterious man appears from the right. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man Underground Dialogue)

"You've finally found your mineral. That sardonyx is the last in the world. Paragon destroyed the rest of it. Paragon turned everything into diamond for its own desire. I hope that stone gives you what you need."

"..."

"You think I'm going to stop you? I'm enjoying this, you fool. You still don't know what happened, do you? No matter. You'll find out soon enough. Take care of the sardonyx, you hear? I'll see you soon."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man leaves to the left.

The player character picks up the sardonyx.

(Cutscene end)

(Add Sardonyx to Inventory)

The sardonyx makes the blade stronger than anything else, giving the player character a significant advantage.

The only path for the player character is up the elevator. Before leaving, the player character finds a mysterious device on the ground. He picks it up.

(Add Mysterious Device to Inventory)

Leaving the underground facility leads to the old man waiting outside. This gives dialogue.

(Old Man After Elevator Dialogue)

"It looks like you found your mineral. Good for you! I know when I was your age, I had a mineral, but it wasn't as bright as the one you have, and... Hey, what's that? You found something?"

He examines the mysterious device.

"You know, I think I recognize that, I'm just not exactly sure what it does. What was it again? A razor? When I was younger, I had a razor, but it wasn't electronic like the ones you get these days. Mine was a manual, and you had to... Oh, right, the device. Well, I'll think about it, and let me get back to you. I think that thing is important, I'm just not sure why yet. I'll see you later, kid."

(End dialogue)

The sardonyx lets the blade cut through diamond. This unlocks many new areas in the open world.

The diamond at the entrance to the Spring area cannot be cut with the blade. Trying this gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The Chief appears. This gives dialogue.

(Chief Outside Spring Area Dialogue)

"It seems even the sardonyx can't cut through the diamond here. It's okay, I have some advice that may help you. The old man asked me to look at the texts about that device you have. The texts called it an electrolarynx. I'm not sure what that is, but the texts told me it can help you get through the diamond. Go ahead and try using it. I'm not sure how a razor is going to get through that diamond, but you should try it anyway. I'll leave you to it."

(End dialogue)

The Chief leaves.

(Cutscene end)

(Update Mysterious Device to Electrolarynx)

The electrolarynx can be used as a special item. Using it gives spoken audio depending on the environment and performs actions. The default word is 'OPEN', and the electrolarynx flashes red and gives an error sound. If a sealed door is nearby, the electrolarynx flashes green and gives a success sound. This opens any nearby sealed doors.

Using the electrolarynx near the entrance to the Spring area gives spoken audio.

(Play Audio 'SHATTER')

(Display Subtitle 'SHATTER')

The diamond at the entrance to the Spring area shatters, opening the entrance.

Spring Area

The Spring area does not have the metal flooring or walls of the industrial areas. This area is completely natural. It has no oil, and clear water flows through streams and waterfalls. There are vines and trees everywhere, making platforming, cutting vines and the use of the electrolarynx needed for progression. Some parts of the environment can be moved with the electrolarynx. When this is possible, the audio 'MOVE' plays.

(Play Audio 'MOVE')

(Display Subtitle 'MOVE')

Upon reaching the end of the Spring area, the player character enters a large battle area. Large vines cover the exit, and a vine knocks the electrolarynx out of the player character's hand. It is lost in the thick vines. The mysterious man appears. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man Spring Area Dialogue)

"After all this time, here you are. Finally ready to face what happened, are you? Not quite yet. I have one more thing for you. Ready? Sure you are."

(End dialogue)

The mysterious man summons a large natural creature surrounded in vines.

(Begin Spring Area Boss Battle)

(Display Text 'Commander of Nature')

(Display Large Text 'Eostre')

Eostre is the Spring area boss. She attacks with vines, and is extremely difficult to hit. The player character needs to freeze vines and burn or cut through them to reach her vulnerable spot, the vines around her neck. Fire and blade attacks are the most effective, but her protective vines grow back quickly unless they are frozen first. Defeating Eostre causes her to drop the electrolarynx. This gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The mysterious man reappears. This gives dialogue.

(Mysterious Man After Defeating Eostre Dialogue)

"So you've really done it, huh?"

The player character picks up the electrolarynx.

"Do you know what that is? You know what it does by now, but do you know how? This is all your fault. You remember, don't you?"

The player character uses the electrolarynx.

(Play Audio 'FREEZE')

(Display Subtitle 'FREEZE')

Eostre becomes frozen.

"What are you doing? She's the only thing protecting this area. This is the last place in the world unaffected by the Industry. I thought stopping the Industry was what you wanted, or am I wrong?"

(Play Audio 'BURN')

(Display Subtitle 'BURN')

Eostre bursts into flames.

"Just as I thought. You care nothing for the natural world. You only want to take things for yourself. While we watch the last being protecting this world burn to death, let me tell you about your past."

"Your voice can command things. We made sure of that. Your last attempt at this was too dangerous, so we removed your vocal cords. That didn't stop you from finding a way to destroy things. You may be trying to stop me, or to stop the things going on in this world, but I have news for you. The only thing that needs to be stopped is you."

Eostre has been reduced to a pile of ash. The mysterious man begins glowing blue and revives her.

"So, I'm going to give you one last chance. Turn back before you cause even more destruction."

(Play Audio 'FREEZE')

(Display Subtitle 'FREEZE')

Eostre becomes frozen again.

"Not going to stop, are you?"

(Play Audio 'SHATTER')

(Display Subtitle 'SHATTER')

Eostre shatters into innumerable pieces. the Spring area immediately begins decaying.

"That's what I thought. You just can't help yourself, can you? Now that the world is truly doomed, I have one more thing to tell you. But we can't do it here. Meet me where you found the sardonyx. I'll be waiting."

The mysterious man floats away.

(End dialogue)

The ashes of Eostre form a glowing green ball in the center of the battle area.

(Cutscene end)

Interacting with the glowing green ball gives a cutscene.

(Cutscene start)

The green ball surrounds the player character and infuses him with the power of healing.

(Display Text 'The healing energy of nature is now at your command.')

This unlocks healing projectiles.

The vines blocking the exit wither and drop to the ground.

(Cutscene end)

The player character has no other path but to return to the entrance of the Spring area. As the player character leaves the Spring area, the vines blocking the ground decay. Oil flows where water once did. Anything that cannot normally be passed can be frozen and walked over with the electrolarynx. Healing projectiles will restore vines to places where they have been destroyed, allowing new paths to be opened in other areas.

By the time the player character leaves the Spring area, it has decayed into nothing but withered plants and oil.

Leaving the Spring area leads to an empty world, with everything darker than before. No one can be found anywhere.

The player character can now explore the entire game, and when ready, can fight the final boss.
