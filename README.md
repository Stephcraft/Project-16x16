# Project-16x16
Looking for a cool project ? well here is a good one !
Project 16x16 is a 2D Platformer game made using java/processing. **You** are able to contribute to this project. The goal is to make a cool game in processing together, that includes **You**. Plus, if you are not a programmer, well this is a game so, we also need cool ideas for gameplay mechanics and story, level designers, also people who can do soundtracks/audio, and artists ! We are already using the amazing industrial tileset made by [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset), **but!** Additional art can be added like UI designs, effects and **epic bosses for epic boss fights** ;)

## How do I start!
