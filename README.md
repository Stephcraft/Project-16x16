# Project-16x16
Project 16x16 is a 2D Platformer game made using the [Processing](https://processing.org) library for Java. 

We invite you to **contribute to this project** -- the goal is to make a cool game in Processing together (that includes **you**). 

If you are not a programmer, you can still contribute: we need ideas for gameplay mechanics and story, level designers, soundtracks/audio, and artists! We are already using the amazing industrial tileset made by [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset) **but** it's limited: additional art like UI designs, effects and **epic bosses for epic boss fights** is also needed!

## How do I start?
Wow!! This project seems **EPIC!** Right? And its made in Processing, like *whhhooaaahht* ! So, how do I get in? How do I start?

### Everybody
* Join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zDJSCqd) -- this is where anything and everything (not just code) relating to development is discussed.

#### Programmers
1. Read about [Processing](https://processing.org) (if you haven't already) -- we also recommend the video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VLaIr5Ckbs&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZYJC7L-r6rX6utt6wwJCyi).
2. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/Stephcraft/Project-16x16/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md) -- this will explain how to get started and delve into the code.

#### Artists, Sound designers, Ideas
* Write your ideas in the repository folder `idea` in the text file format of your choice, for exemple: `.md`, `.txt` or `.docx` (or share on Discord).
